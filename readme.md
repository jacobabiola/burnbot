To install the required libraries and dependencies for running the Telegram bot script, you can use pip, the package manager for Python. Open a terminal or command prompt and follow these steps:

Step 1: Install Python (if you haven't already)
If you don't have Python installed, you can download and install it from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Step 2: Install required libraries
Run the following commands to install the required libraries (requests, web3, and python-telegram-bot):


```bash
pip install requests
pip install web3
pip install json
pip install time
pip install os.path
pip install re
pip install python-telegram-bot

```
Step 3: Set up Telegram bot
To create your own Telegram bot and obtain a bot token, follow these steps:

Open the Telegram app on your device.
Search for the "BotFather" bot and start a chat with it.
Use the /newbot command to create a new bot and follow the instructions to choose a name and username for your bot.
Once your bot is created, the BotFather will provide you with a bot token. Save this token as you'll need it in the script.

Step 4: Update the script
Replace the placeholder BOT_TOKEN in the script with the token provided by the BotFather. Also, replace '@yaratoken' with the actual Telegram group ID where you want to send the alert messages. and add the etherscan API key

Step 5: Run the script
Now, you are ready to run the script.  and execute it:

```bash

python burnBot.py
```
The script will start the Telegram bot and begin listening for token burn events on Ethereum and PulseChain networks. Whenever a token burn event occurs for the specified tokens, the bot will send an alert message to the specified Telegram group.

Make sure to keep the script running continuously (you can use a server or a cloud-based service) if you want to receive real-time alerts for token burn events.
